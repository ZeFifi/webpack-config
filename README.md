# Webpack project starter

This repo hosts a ready-to-use Webpack project starter if you work with HTML/CSS/SCSS/Vanilla JS. If you want to build it on your own instead of downloading it, feel free to go to my Medium article [here](https://medium.com/@ZeFifi/d%C3%A9buter-avec-webpack-partie-1-import-export-et-compilation-ffd45bb3943d).

## Features
- SCSS to CSS compilation
- ES5 to ES6 compilation
- CSS/JS minification
- Local server with HMR (Hot Module Reload)
- Nice interface thanks to Webpack Dashboard

## Launch
You can launch it by 3 ways :
- `npm run dev` : no local server, no minification
- `npm run prod` : no local server, minification
- `npm run start` : local server, hot module reload, no minification
